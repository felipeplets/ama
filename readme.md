# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer.

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

Want to know what I'm up to? Then check my [Now Page](https://plets.me/now/)

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow. Feel free to then send it to me over here if you feel I can help answering.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

*I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/felipeplets) and [email](mailto:felipe@plets.me), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/felipeplets/ama/issues/new).*
